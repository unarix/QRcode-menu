# QRcode-Menu
A major concern for restaurants right now is no use physical menus. Since customers are hesitant to touch these!

## Entities:
**Menu**:  The menu entity is built to support different categories of items.
**Orders**: The requests entity is capable of eliminating orders that have already been completed.

## Database:
This project dont uses a database; instead it uses json documents to store the entities.

## Proyect Type:
The solution is a MVC Razor (core .net).
